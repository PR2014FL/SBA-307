Welcome to my travels website! In this first iterance, I want to highlight three places I've traveled to: Netherlands, Peru, and my home country, Puerto Rico. 

Reflection (optional)
Once you have completed your project, answer the following questions to help solidify your understanding of the process and its outcomes.

a.	What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

What would have made this project easier would have been to go back and use my old practice exercises, but I wanted to challeneg myself and start from scratch. It was the best thing to do now that enough time to work on it. On the contrary, if it were an on-the-spot assessment I would have gone back and copied previous code as a starter. 

b.	Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

I ran into an issue where the div was invading other div spaces when I reduced the height of the browser window. I tried different CSS proptorties like height and box-sizing, but these did not work. I reached to Bryan who led me to Overstack and he found the answer immediately. (I would NOT have found it as fast!) It turns out that I was using VH for height and that forced the element to want to stay in the screen. I removed the height (by commenting it out) and everything fit and behaved correctly.

c.	What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?

I don't think I would change much. I would definitely add the 3 additional pages for each album: Netherlands, Peru, and Puerto Rico!

d.	Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.

Look back and see if going into previous branches and forking them will help as a head start to future projects.
